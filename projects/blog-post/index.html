                Typography is one of the most important elements of front end design and development! In this exercise, we'll play around with some of the common CSS properties to manage and style our fonts by making a nice blog post-like web page.

        <h2>All About Typography</h2>
        <p class="uppercase">
          Headlines, like this one, are great ways to quickly capture the
          reader's attention, to give them a sumary, intro, or other important
          information in a web page. You can use
          <span class="red">text-transform: uppercase;</span> to make a whole
          body of text uppercase using CSS if you really need to grab attention!
        </p>
        <p>
          Okay, now that we're done screaming in the headline in all caps (which
          you should do sparingly) - it's time to chat more about other
          components of typography. You'll notice that we chose a nice serif
          font for our headings, and a nice sans-serif font for our body text.
          This is intentional! Serif font faces are generally considered pretty
          inaccessible as a body text style, since at smaller sizes it's much
          more difficult to visually differentiate the characters from one
          another. At large font sizes, such as those seen in most headings,
          serif fonts are considered fine, since the larger style makes it
          easier to see where serif characters start and where they end.
        </p>
        <p>
          But wait! What if you want more than just normal text on your page?
          Another common thing you might see in web pages are quotes. To make
          quotes, we can use the blockquote element and style it accordingly, so
          it stands out a bit as a non-body text quote.

            it some nice styling. Pretty nice, huh? A great lesson in User
            Experience Design, where we take special care to implement our web
            page in a way that makes it pleasant and intuitive for our
            users/readers. Differentiating our different typography components
            visually makes information much more organized and easier to digest
            for our users."

        <h3 class="capitalize">a new section</h3>
        <p>
          And just like that, we've got a new section of content separated by a
          <span class="red">hr</span> element (a 'horizontal rule' or a divider)
          and a new heading. Isn't putting content together fun?
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice as well that when we entered in the
          <span class="red uppercase">H3</span> content, it was all lowercase,
          but now it's in a nice Title Case, where the first letter of each word
          is capitalized. We did that with CSS! Using
          <span class="red">text-transform: capitalize;</span>
          we can implement title cased content.

        <h3>Common Font Sizing Approaches</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>
              <span class="unit"><span class="red">px</span> (pixels)</span>
            </h4>
            <p>
              Pixels are the simplest way to hard code your font size. By
              default the browser sets the root font size to
              <span class="red">16px</span>, but you can change the font size in
              the <span class="red">body</span> element or any other HTML
              element by setting <span class="red">font-size</span> to any
              number of <span class="red">px</span>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>
              <span class="unit"><span class="red">em</span></span>
            </h4>
            <p>
              <span class="red">em</span> units size font relative to the parent
              element. For example, if the <span class="red">body</span> element
              is <span class="red">16px</span>, and a nested
              <span class="red">div</span> element's font size is set to
              <span class="red">1.5em</span>, the browser will multiply 16px x
              1.5, resulting in <span class="red">24px</span> font in the div.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>
              <span class="unit"><span class="red">rem</span> (root em)</span>
            </h4>
            <p>
              Root <span class="red">em</span> units are similar to
              <span class="red">em</span>, but they are relative to the root
              font size instead of the parent element of whatever is being
              styled. For example, if the root font size (the font size of the
              <span class="red">body</span> element) is set to 16px, and we have
              a <span class="red">p</span> element nested many layers down with
              a font-size set to <span class="red">2rem</span>, that paragraph
              will have 32px font. If the body font size ever changes, this
              paragraph will also change accordingly.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Which one do I use?</h4>
        <p>
          Great question! Generally, people try to stick to using
          <span class="red">em</span> or <span class="red">rem</span> over
          <span class="red">px</span>, since they make responsive typography
          that scales up and down across different device widths much easier.
          Using <span class="red">px</span> for your font sizes is not as
          dynamic, and you may find that writing media queries to update all the
          various element font sizes in pixels at different screen widths is not
          the most scalable approach to typography.
        </p>
        <p>
          Between <span class="red">em</span> and <span class="red">rem</span>,
          <span class="red">rem</span> has a nice advantage of all elements
          being relative to one single root font value, where nested elements
          with parent/child font size dependencies can still be hard to manage
          with <span class="red">em</span> units. When writing responsive
          styles, <span class="red">rem</span> allows you to simply update the
          root font size at different screen sizes and all elements using
          <span class="red">rem</span> units will adjust themselves accordingly
          creating a super easy-to-manage typography size system.
        </p>
        <p>
          In small projects you may not have an issues hard coding pixelage, but
          it's always important to understand the drawbacks of writing styles
          that may not be responsive or dynamic.
